## Introduction:
Employees are the heart of every organization, and understanding why they leave is critical to long-term success. This project explores HR attrition data to uncover key factors driving employee turnover, such as job role, years at the company, and income.

Using Power BI, I transformed the dataset into interactive dashboards that reveal patterns and trends in attrition. These insights can help HR teams strengthen retention strategies and create workplaces where employees thrive.

## Key Metrics:

1. Overall Attrition Rate
2. Total Employee Count
3. Yearly Attrition Trend
4. Average Employee Years at the Company
5. Attrition Count by Job Satisfaction
6. Attrition Count by Work-life Balance
7. Attrition Count by Department
8. Attrition Count by Job Involvement
    

## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:

The following Power BI features were incorporated
- Data Gathering
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Data Visualization
- Dax Measures
-  Calculated columns
- Dashboard Automation

### Analysis:

### Average Monthly Income of Employee
The average monthly income of employees shows a declining trend over the last three years. In 2023, employees earned an average of $4.95k, which dropped slightly to $4.68k in 2024, and further declined to $4.11k in 2025.

This downward shift suggests potential issues such as reduced salary adjustments, limited promotions, or organizational restructuring. A continuous decrease in income may affect employee satisfaction and could be linked to higher attrition rates.


### Total number of Employees
The workforce has seen major shifts over the past four years. Employee count was 128 in 2022, held steady at 127 in 2023, then spiked to 171 in 2024 before dropping sharply to just 44 in 2025. This drastic fall signals serious retention or restructuring challenges that require closer review.

### Average Employee Years at the Company
The average tenure has steadily declined over time, from 3 years in 2022 to 2 years in 2023, then dropping to just 1 year in 2024, and falling further to less than a year in 2025. This trend points to rising turnover and reduced employee retention, which could weaken organizational stability and experience levels.

### Overall Attrition Rate
Attrition has risen sharply over the years, climbing from 16% in 2022 to 21% in 2023, then jumping to 35% in 2024 and 36% in 2025. This upward trend highlights growing challenges in employee retention, suggesting deeper issues with satisfaction, compensation, or workplace conditions.

### Attrition Count by Job Satisfaction
Attrition cut across all satisfaction levels. In 2024, the numbers were fairly even, with 17 employees with high satisfaction left, alongside 14 each from the low, medium, and very high groups. By 2025, the figures dropped overall but still raised concern, with 6 from both high and low groups, and just a few from medium and very high.
This shows that attrition affects employees regardless of satisfaction rating, suggesting that external factors such as pay, career growth, or restructuring, may drive turnover more than job satisfaction alone.

## Conclusion
- Employee attrition has increased significantly, more than doubling from 16% in 2022 to 36% in 2025.

- Average monthly income declined steadily, which may have impacted employee morale and retention.

- Workforce size dropped sharply in 2025, indicating possible restructuring or high turnover.

- Average tenure fell below one year in 2025, showing that newer employees are not staying long.

- Attrition occurred across all job satisfaction levels, suggesting that factors beyond satisfaction, such as pay, growth opportunities, or organizational stability, play a major role.

### Recommendation
- Review compensation policies to ensure salaries remain competitive with the market.

- Invest in career growth and development programs to retain skilled employees.

- Strengthen onboarding and support for new hires to improve retention.

- Conduct employee feedback surveys to identify hidden drivers of attrition beyond job satisfaction.

- Build targeted retention strategies focusing on both high- and low-satisfaction groups since attrition is spread across all levels.
